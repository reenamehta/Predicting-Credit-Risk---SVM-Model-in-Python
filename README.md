CREDIT RISK CASE STUDY Credit Risk: Credit risk is nothing but the default in payment of any loan by the borrower. In Banking sector this is an important factor to be considered before approving the loan of an applicant. Impact of Credit Risk: The bankâ€™s revenue pattern depends on the saving account and loans they offer. Once an account holder puts money in their saving account, they get certain interest on their account balance. The bank keeps some part of these balances in reserve to make payments in case of withdrawals. The rest of the money is given as loans to borrowers. The interest put on loan is the revenue earned by the banks. Therefore taking into consideration the factors that will decide whether a person will pay back the loan or not is crucial for banks. This is a common credit risk problem which is solved using analytics. While receiving application of a borrower, the bank asks certain details about the applicant. The general factors that help predict loan default are income, occupation, age, loan amount etc of the applicant.
